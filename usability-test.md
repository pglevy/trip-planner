" want to search
- I have no idea
- Eenie meenie minie mow
- destination (didn't see to reverse them)
- very faint grey
- what are these? (stations)
- don't know where in new jersey I want to be
- but what's there?
- I want to know what's around Hammenton, NJ
- blueberry capital of the world
- I should have done this earlier
- nobody know what station is where
- should have googled where I want to go first
- need to do research first
- painful
- what did you like?
    - date and where you're going is easy
    - picking options is confusing
- thought it would be all business
- wasn't clear about return trip
- two different trains
- page you started on
    - map is moving
    - amtrak thing
    - zooming kind of weird
- not looking like you're planning your trip
- if you went to amtrak plan your trip
    - sound like you browse around and plan your itinerary
    - almost like travel agent
    - you want to see what to do in that city, what I should be doing
    - amtrak is just buying tickets from point A to point B
