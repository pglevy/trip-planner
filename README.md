# Trip planner

**A design challenge to enhance the [Amtrak trip planning experience](https://www.amtrak.com/plan-your-trip.html)**

My approach and artifacts are organized below according to “four contexts”: problem discovery, problem validation, solution discovery, and solution validation. For my thoughts and initial writing on this approach, you can see [more detail here](https://github.com/pglevy/four-contexts/blob/main/four-contexts.md).

## Problem discovery

### [Heuristic evaluation](https://bixal.github.io/methods/heuristic-evaluation)

- [Initial evaluation and prioritization](https://heurio.app/project/dU80U0cveHpZWjZyYURIMjZCK1NDZz09) completed using Huerio.
- Time: 30m

### [Usability test](https://bixal.github.io/methods/usability-testing) (current site)

- Prompt: You want to plan a romantic getaway weekend, but you don't want to drive and you don't want to deal with the hassle of flying. So you decide to book travel on the train. Go ahead and use this link to plan your trip.

## Problem validation

### [Summary of findings](https://bixal.github.io/methods/fundamentals/findings/)

- Themes:
    - Usability issues (Map, Inputs, System status)
    - Understanding options
    - Mental model mismatch of trip planning vs. buying tickets
- Time: 15m

### [Design hypothesis](https://bixal.github.io/methods/design-hypothesis) (Lean UX Canvas)

- [View Lean UX Canvas on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/124OJNQi8K72GziD1rvknJLwNsIVZxmBPcxq7Vl1mYD0/edit?usp=sharing)
- Time: 15m

## Solution discovery

### [Design exploration](https://bixal.github.io/methods/design-studio)

<img width="1156" alt="sketches" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177337/151229177-95059c5e-20f4-4ed7-9fde-9b79e3f912f3.png">

- Quick sketches and copy ideas
- Time: 1hr

### [Rapid web prototyping](https://github.com/pglevy/rwp-toolkit#readme)

<img width="1552" alt="quicktix2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177337/151229716-d205c6c6-9aed-4f5f-af37-c607f3d1ea1e.png">

- **Live Prototype: [QuickTix: One-page ticket purchase for common routes](https://pglevy.github.io/trip-planner/quick-tix.html)**
    - Questions:
        - Does this capture everything we need?
        - Do people have additional questions that aren't answered here for this use case?
        - How does it compare to current experience?
- Time: 1hr

## Solution validation

### [Usability test](https://bixal.github.io/methods/usability-testing) (prototype)

- In-person, on mobile device (no recording)
- Time: 30m
